*This is a mock API to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.*

Welcome! This is the unofficial service that tracks the current ranking 
(also known as meta) of the duelists, strategists, and vangaurds in the
hero, shooter video game Marvel Rivals by NetEase Games.

of Marvel Rivals as the game progresses. As of May 22, 2025, Marvel Rivals
realeases a new season every two months (noting the halfway point with .5)
and a new hero every month.

## What can you you do with this service?

For anyone new to this service, there are three specific calls a user can
make:

* Add a new hero
* Edit a current hero's ranking or ability
* Delete a hero
